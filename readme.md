## stegopng

Python stegonography tool with builtin encryption/obfuscation of the data.

## leetifier

Generates "leet" word permutations.

## ssh_user_enum

This is PoC code for CVE-2018-15473 (OpenSSH < 7.7). The advantage of using this particular PoC code is that it allows threading, unlike the vast majority (or all?) other PoC codes you find out there using paramiko.

## substitution_cipher

This is byte-substitution cipher code. I also included a variant that does substitution + encryption.

## url_share

Shares links across a local network and opens them in the default webbrowser. It uses UDP broadcast, encrypts/decrypts at client and server, and prompts you before sending a URL off.
